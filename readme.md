When the program starts, it will continuously and randomly reorder a deck of
cards, remembering each order it produces. When an order has appeared more than
once, it stops. This program demonstrates how long it would take to achieve
two identical deck orders through random shuffling. In fact, the program will
start to take a significant amount of time even if there are only 12 cards. So
if you select 13 cards, chances are your program is going to freeze for a
while. `13!` *(13 factorial)* is already **QUITE BIG!!**
